# DM552: Programming Languages

This repository contains the public material and information related to the 
[Programming Languages](https://odinlister.sdu.dk/fagbesk/internkode/DM552/en)
offered by the IMADA Department at SDU.

The course is a mandatory course in the bachelor program giving an introduction
to the main concepts and the structure of programming languages, paying
particular attention to the functional paradigm. It fosters a coherent understanding of
advantages and disadvantages of different levels of abstraction and programming
language constructs, giving to the participants the experience with programming
in languages other than the mainstream object-oriented languages.

The course is divided into two main modules that will be thought in parallel:
* programming language: principles and paradigms
* functional programming: Haskell

The first module will introduce the general concepts of programming languages
either using linguistic mechanism or the implementation structures corresponding
to them in a manner that is independent of any specific language. The second
module instead focus on one concrete language, Haskell, to allow students to get
familiar with the functional programming paradigm.

## Course Material

The course will rely on the following two books:
* Programming Languages: Principles and Paradigms (Gabbrielli Maurizio, Martini Simone)
* Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!: A Beginner's Guide (Miran Lipovaca)

The additional course material is available on this git repository.
Material that can not be made public will be available on the
[Blackboard platform](https://e-learn.sdu.dk/).

## Exam

To complete the course the student has to pass a written exam having questions
covering all the topics presented in class. The written exam will be evaluated
using a 7 grades scale with the collaboration of an external examiner. No
external auxiliary material (e.g., books, personal notes) will be allowed to be
used during the exam.
